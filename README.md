# Apollo-server Playground

**Apollo Server 2** is a library which makes it easy to create a **GraphQL server** in JavaScript.  
In this repo I played around with how to get Apollo Server 2 installed, setting a new project and implementing a GraphQL server.

## Steps to have app up and running

1. Navigate to the apollo-server folder and type in the Command line - `npm install`

2. Type `npm run start` and navigate to the `http://localhost:4000/`

### App description

So far, application takes only data from the local array of objects. It will be more complicated examples in the future.
